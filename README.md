# The-Hood

## Project Description
This is a web application that enables a user to be in the loop about everything happening in his/her neighborhood, from the emergency contact information to different business posts. Users are first authorized before they can use the application, after which they can join a neighborhood and view the different business posts as well as create new posts to be viewed by other members in a particular neighborhood.
